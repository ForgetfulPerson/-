# awesome sandbox
## intro
sooo i made this a few months ago and i haven't touched it since.\
maybe i'll try to update the css, because it looks like trash right now.\
you can see what it looks like [here](http:/alexzcode.github.io/awesomesandbox), but\
chrome marks it as a phishing attempt, and i can't really do anythign about it since i already sent another report.
## features
so, im gonna list all the things you can do:
- box spawn
- box custom width and height
- ball spawn
- custom ball size
- triangle spawn
- custom triangle size
- clear simulation
- pausing/resuming simulation
